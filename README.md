# 🧠 Student Exam Anxiety Detector

A full-stack AI-powered web application that analyzes student statements and classifies their anxiety level as **Low**, **Moderate**, or **High** — with personalized suggestions and interactive calming exercises.

## 📌 Project Overview

Students often struggle to identify and articulate their anxiety levels before exams. This app provides a simple interface where a student types how they feel — and an AI model instantly classifies their mental state and suggests targeted coping strategies.

## 🧪 Model & Training

### Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle — Student Mental Health Statements Dataset
- **Size:** 50,000+ entries
- **Columns:** `statement` (text), `status` (mental health label)

### Label Remapping
The original labels were remapped into 3 anxiety levels:

| Original Label | Anxiety Level |
|---|---|
| Normal | 🟢 Low Anxiety |
| Anxiety | 🟡 Moderate Anxiety |
| Depression, Bipolar, Suicidal | 🔴 High Anxiety |

### Class Imbalance Problem
The dataset was heavily imbalanced:
- Normal: ~19,000 entries
- Anxiety: ~6,000 entries
- Others: remaining

This caused the model to predict everything as "Normal". Fixed using:
- **Resampling** — all classes oversampled/undersampled to 9,000 entries each
- **Class weights** — `class_weight="balanced"` in the classifier
- **Weighted loss** — `CrossEntropyLoss` with computed class weights

### Model Architecture
Two approaches were explored:

#### Approach 1 — DistilBERT (Transformer-based)
- Model: `distilbert-base-uncased` via HuggingFace Transformers
- Tokenizer: AutoTokenizer with max_length=128
- Fine-tuned for sequence classification (3 labels)
- Trained on Kaggle GPU with 5 epochs
- Higher accuracy (~88-94%) but larger model size

#### Approach 2 — TF-IDF + Random Forest (Classical ML) ✅ Used in Production
- Vectorizer: `TfidfVectorizer(max_features=10000, ngram_range=(1,2))`
- Classifier: `RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200, class_weight="balanced")`
- Trained and evaluated on Kaggle
- Serialized using `joblib` with compression level 9
- Lighter and faster for deployment on free-tier infrastructure

### Training Environment
- Platform: **Kaggle Notebooks**
- GPU: Kaggle free-tier GPU (for DistilBERT experiments)
- Final model saved as `anxiety_model.pkl`

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User (React Frontend)
        ↓  POST /predict
FastAPI Backend (Hugging Face Spaces)
        ↓  loads anxiety_model.pkl
        ↓  returns { anxiety_level, confidence }
Back to React → Result Page → Suggestions → Exercises
```
